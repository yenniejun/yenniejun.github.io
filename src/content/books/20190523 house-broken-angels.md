I really liked this book. It took place only over the span of a weekend. Urrea did a poignantly beautiful job describing the life of two men, interwoven for life. Big Angel's love forever for his wife really touched me. All of the characters felt very organic and real. Urrea's careful attention to detail and beautifully succinct writing brought the story to vivid luminosity.
