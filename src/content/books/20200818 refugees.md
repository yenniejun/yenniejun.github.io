I loved this collection of short stories. It was a great collection of short stories. This was the kind of collection I wanted to write when I went to Korea to write "Tangent Lines". They were poignant and funny and I loved how each one had the thread of "Vietnam refugee" and yet, each story was so complete and distinct. I loved how he was able to portray so many kinds of stories, and also from so many kinds of POVs. I thought this collection was very beautifully done. It reminded me a lot of James Joyce's Dubliners (in terms of organization and thematic content)
