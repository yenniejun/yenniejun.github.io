This was such a beautiful, lyrical book. The plot built up like a labyrinth, and the words spilled out like poetry and song. The world building was on point. I have more respect for authors who can create worlds in limited space because they really get to the point (as opposed to world building over many, many books, which is also commendable, but sometimes I donâ€™t have time for that). The writing was great and the story was SO cool and so interesting. The plot, too, as it unraveled, and the characters, as they were revealed. The relationship between Raphael and Piranesi at the end is just so wholesome. The fact that they both go visit the labyrinth together or alone is so beautiful.
