Very beautifully written. Rupi Kaur's words really resounded with me. I think she took her life and her experiences and her pain which many women share often (of heartbreak and pain and healing) and created something beautiful and uplifting. And it goes with her message at the end that she doesn't wanna be the girl unlike the others and how she hates the culture of women putting other women down, and how women are resilient and beautiful and brave and smart
