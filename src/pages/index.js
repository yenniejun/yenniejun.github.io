          <p>I am currently studying for my Master of Science (MSc) in Social Data Science at the Oxford Internet Internet Institute. I am also part of the Big Data Studies Lab at Seoul National University (SNU), where I investigate the future of digital archives in the age of Big Data.</p>
          <p>Before that, I was a software engineer at Microsoft on the Education team.</p>
          <p>Before that, I graduated from Tufts University with a B.S. in computer science, B.A. in history, and minor in music.</p>
          <p>For fun, I love to cycle around the English countryside, hike, do martial arts (Taekwondo), read, and write (anything from short stories to fiction to poetry; check out my Writing!). I also love to play music: piano, flute, accordion, and now trying to learn classical guitar.</p>
