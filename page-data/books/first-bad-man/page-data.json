Cheryl was such a convincing unreliable narrator and from the beginning I was inside her head and all of her quirks and obsessions felt normal through her telling. There was no way to see her world other than through her eyes, her story, her way with words.  Some of the absurdity bordered on Kafka — strange things told in a very straightforward and serious tone. The entire book felt like a very whole piece — all the pieces felt in strange but smooth ways to tell a story I’m not sure happened at all. Such a genius work</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"August 05, 2021","path":"/books/first-bad-man","title":"The First Bad Man","author":"Miranda July","posttype":"books","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21412400-the-first-bad-man","rating":4.5}}},"pageContext":{}},
