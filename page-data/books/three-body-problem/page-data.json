It was a very well done piece of science fiction. Very creatively imagined world, and I loved the setting of it within the Cultural Revolution. Premise: a physicist (Ye) who has been extremely disillusioned by the Cultural Revolution loses faith in humanity, reaches out to extra-terrestial life to help rebuild and destroy humanity. (\"Our civilization is no longer capable of solving its own problems. We need your force to intervene\" (276)).  In the end we get a glimpse into the alien life (Trisolaris), and we see that they are as afraid of humans as humans are of them.</p>\n<p>Pacing was quite slow in the first half of the book, and the second half was exponential growth. I really felt situated in the world. Climax: I'm sure it was supposed to be the wire-slicing of the boat, but honestly, the proton-slicing of the Trisolarian life was emotionally the highlight of the book. The thing that REALLY blew my mind â€” the proton unfolding, and etching an AI into the surface of the proton. That was really the coolest thing ever.</p>\n<p>A question I wondered about: Why not use the intelligent sophons (the protons with circuits etched into them and AI loaded onto their OS) to fix the three body problem, or to shield one of the suns? Make a permanent stable era...</p>\n<h2>Note on Gender</h2>\n<p>I did enjoy that a lot of the astro-physicists WERE women. However, I did NOT like how in 3 Body Problem (the video game), all of the characters were dudes. John pointed out that it's \"historical\" ... but also the video game had a lot of anachronism... So if you're going to have anachronistic historical characters, and the video game is just supposed to be a mechanism to get more people interested in Three Body Problem, then maybe get more women in it. But oh well, I guess it's not the main focus of the book.</p>\n<p>Unfortunate note: whenever female physicists were mentioned their physical descriptions were mentioned (i.e. slender, beautiful) but the same was not done for male physicists.</p>\n<p>Also, when Ye Wenjie is living with the tribe in the Klingan Mountains, she is not seen as a woman but as a scientist and somehow these are separate. \"They all treated Ye with great respect and were very polite toward her. She didn't pay much attention to this at first. But after a while, after observing how those men roughly beat their wives and flirted outrageously with the widows in the village, saying things that made her blush, she finally realized her precious their respect was\" (293)</p>\n<h2>Beautiful Lines</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\"... the thoughts she could not voice dissolved into her blood, where they would stay with her for the rest of her life.\" (20)</li>\n<li>\"Does it represent the yearning for order, or the surrender to chaos?\" (241)</li>\n<li>\"The strings clung to those who went outside, and as they walked, they dragged the lights behind them... \" (363) (after proton unfolding into 1-dimension) \"People thought they had disappeared, but pieces of the one-dimensional string would drift in the air of Trisolaris forever.\"</li>\n<li>\"Those objects, some as large as mountains, had almost no mass.

I feel that the greatest appeal of science fiction is the creation of numerous imaginary worlds outside of reality. I've always felt that the greatest and most beautiful stories in the history of humanity were not sung by wandering bards or written by playwrights and novelists, but told by science. The stories of science are far more magnificent, grand, involved, profound, thrilling, strange, terrifying, mysterious, even emotional, compared to the stories told by literature. Only, these wonderful stories are locked in cold equations that most do not know how to read. ... The creation myths of the various peoples and religions of the world pale when compared to the glory of the big bang..... Through the medium of science fiction, I seek only to create my own worlds using the power of imagination, and to make known the poetry of Nature in those worlds, to tell the romantic legends that have unfolded between Man and Universe\" (393-394)</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Science fiction is a literature that belongs to all humankind.
