It was definitely long in span (breadth and depth). I was impressed with the level of detail he gave to every event and character. I liked the unreliability of the narratorship - which becomes extremely apparent by the end, when Moor basically says that he made up a lot of the things about Carmen and his parents because how would he know the truth? I liked the theme of narrator and how it's really dependent on the story you want to tell.</p>\n<p>That being said, I didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to. Not sure if it was because I wasn't able to focus and it took me too long to read. There were a lot of themes and I wasn't able to follow all of them. Maybe a lot went over my head.</p>\n<p>I liked the strong female characters. I liked how Aurora was larger than life and Uma was sneaky but so charming. I liked how they were such large characters with such influence over the men.</p>\n<h2>Unreliable Narrator</h2>\n<p>I also really liked the unreliable narrator (because perhaps I just love all stories with unreliable narrators)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>\"It is difficult for me, after all these years, to know what to believe...
