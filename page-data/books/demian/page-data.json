Hesse (and his protagonist, Emile Sinclair) explores the main milestones of his \"coming-of-age\" to the realizations about what it means to live life, about what is the meaning of humanity, and what does the process of self-actualization look like. It read more like a philosophical treatise with a narrative sprinkled on time rather than a philosophical novel (for example, Siddhartha felt more like the latter. Steppenwolf felt like something in between these two).</p>\n<p>Parts I did NOT like: the male-dominated nature of the themes of self-realization. Although Mother Eve does make an appearance at the end, it felt more to me that she was a vehicle, as the carrier, as an object, as this sort-of supernatural being who has already attained some form of enlightenment, rather than being another fellow-man struggling to figure out the purpose of his or her life. She was the the \"mother\" figure and for me it felt like she was too entrenched in the \"motherly\" role (and the incestuous overlap for \"lover\" role for Sinclair as well).</p>\n<p>The ending felt very abrupt, but perhaps that was intentional. Most of the book felt very wandering, dream-like, self-reflective... and then Max dies suddenly. And that is just the ending.</p>\n<p>Truly, Max did feel like some sort of daemon, pursuing the details of Sinclair's life without any logic to his patterns. In fact, it mirrored more of the \"inevitable\" details of life that seem to just happen in nature. It seems like Hesse's message is one more of predetermination - not int he sense of the Christian church, but in the sense more of Spinoza. That is - you must accept things to be the way they are, not because God has willed it so, but because you have willed it so.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"A giant bird was fighting its way out of the egg, and the egg was the world, and the world had to go to ruin\" (88).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Basically you need to tear apart the world as you know it to reach your own self-realization. Similarly, the \"old world\" (Europe in early 1900s) was corrupt and bound in its old ways and sentiments and thus NEEDED to have some sort of great war to bring it to ruin, so that the world could also reach some sort of self-actualization. Maybe Hesse was hoping to mirror the personal journey of self-realization in the marcrocosm of the world. (Unfortunately, not so, because then WWII broke up, and then all the other wars... Wonder what Hesse thinks about that).</p>\n<p>Thought: Mother Eve and Demian and their whole group want to break free from the \"herd\" mentality that drives the current \"community\" of the day, to be different, to achieve self-realization. However, they were both still shaped by their experiences form the old system. So their thoughts are actually not entirely new.</p>\n<p>ONE QUESTION I was left with was - did Sinclair love Demian? It seems throughout the whole book that he is obsessed with Demian on an erotic level as well. Obviously Sinclair looks up to Demian as a friend, teacher, and mentor... but also as a potential lover? There seemed to be some potential homosexual undertones as well... When he dreams about and paints portraits that look like Demian... And then, especially, at the end, right before Demian dies, when he kisses Sinclair on the lips!!

Only one thing I could not do:  <strong>Discover the dark, concealed aim within me and make up my mind, as others did</strong>  — others, who knew well enough whether they wanted to be professors or judges, doctors or artists. They knew what career to follow and what advantages they would gain by it. But I was not like that. Perhaps I would be like them some day, but how was I to know?

But to no one is it permitted to choose his office for himself, and to discharge it as he likes.
