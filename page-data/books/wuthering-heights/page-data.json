It is so vivid and unique in its plot and characterization and spirit.</p>\n<p>This time I think I caught a lot more of the physical violence that happened in the book (for example, Heathcliff bashing Hindley's head until blood comes). I think both Cathy's are annoying, although the younger is a bit better. Heathcliff is such a fascinating character</p>\n<p>Honestly, I think Nelly is also a very interesting character. She is the unreliable narrator through which we receive most of the story. She has been quiet when she could have remedied situations, she has spilled secrets when she should not have, and she has made worse some situations. She always meant well but she was always nosy and always a little gossipy. Although to be fair, there's nothing else to do I guess.</p>\n<h2>Some musings:</h2>\n<p>I almost wonder if Heathcliff is (the older) Cathy's doppelgänger. When Cathy says, \"I am Heathcliff\" ... They are in love in a way that is past passion and past healthy loving relationship. Even Heathcliff admits too that he IS Cathy and that they cannot exist without each other. In fact, the only reason that he did not kill himself after Cathy died was because he wanted to exact his revenge upon what he THOUGHT was the cause of all of their respective miseries. When Cathy dies Heathcliff essentially becomes a split self of her wildest self as a man. I also wonder if Cathy + Heathcliff is Emily Bronte's projection of herself ... The combination of both of them is what Emily Bronte imagines her own self and soul to look like.</p>\n<p>I think the worst character is Linton. He is so annoying. When he taunts Hareton for being stupid and illiterate, I find that this unpleasant trait is present in his father as well (when Edgar taunts Heathcliff for being stupid). The taunting behavior of both father and son reveals some deep insecurities, and also worsens the situation for EVERYONE involved.</p>\n<p>I think the true villain in this story is probably Mr. Earnshaw. He raised his children in a way such that Hindley and Catherine both had so many attachment issues. Like if he had probably given Hindley the love and attention he needed he probably would not have been as jealous of Heathcliff and then they could have all been friends, but NO. That couldn't happen.</p>\n<p>In general I am very impressed with this story because there really is none like it. Emily Bronte's scope and language and storytelling is marvelous, and her deep character analyses are fascinating as artwork. She doesn't put her opinion (or I guess, Nelly doesn't) on any character and doesn't sympathize with one more than another, and I think that semi-objectivity adds a lot more to the weight of the story.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 14, 2020","path":"/books/wuthering-heights","title":"Wuthering Heights","author":"Emily Brontë","posttype":"books","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6185.Wuthering_Heights","rating":4.2}}},"pageContext":{}},
