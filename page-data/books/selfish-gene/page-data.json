I understand that this book is a \"classic\" but I couldn't really get into it. Maybe it was his tone and writing style, which felt a bit condescending, but also maybe it's the writing style of the 60s (it felt a lot like Dale Carnegie's writing style. not my favorite). Parts felt repetitive. The parts I could resonate the most with were the parts where he gave concrete examples.</p>\n<p>All of the weighting gene relatedness with family members felt very over-simplified. There were a couple arguments I had trouble following or felt very hand-wavy. I got the general gist of what he was getting at, but sometimes I found his arguments boring or not very compelling. Not sure if it is because I wasn't able to engage fully, because I did not understand the material completely, because I wasn't that interested, or because the arguments were flawed.</p>\n<p>That being said, there were a lot of cool parts in the book.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<h1>Notes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\"I am not advocating a morality based on evolution. I am saying how things have evolved. I am not saying how we humans morally ought to behave.\" (3)\n<ul>\n<li>I guess it is good that he explicitly says this from the beginning</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Altruistic entity = behaves in such a way as to increase another such entity's welfare at the expense of its own. Selfish entity = opposite effect\n<ul>\n<li>Behavioral, not subjective</li>\n<li>\"Even while the group is going slowly and inexorably downhill, selfish individuals prosper in the short term at the expense of altruists\" (10)\n<ul>\n<li>This is true in history. Example: Japanese collaborators in Korea during the Japanese occupation of Korea</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ethic of \"speciesism\" - \"the feeling that members of one's own species deserve special moral consideration as compared with members of other species\" (12)</li>\n<li>Replicator = mold or template with affinity for its own kind (building block)\n<ul>\n<li>Due to competition, replicators evolved cumulatively and progressively to become survival machine</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\"Nothing actually wants to evolve. Evolution is something that happens, willy-nilly, in spite of all the efforts of the replicators to prevent it happening\" (22)</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"There is nothing sacred about definitions. We can define a word how we like for our own purposes, provided we do so clearly and unambiguously\"\" (36)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Lifespan of a chromosome is 1 generation</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The genes survive</li>\n<li>Genes/cistrons leave one body and enter the next aboard a sperm or egg into the next generation ... \"they are likely to find that the little vessel contains their close neighbors of the previous voyage\"</li>\n<li>Not unlike Buddhism and reincarnation!</li>\n<li>\"A gene is not indivisible, but it is seldom divided\" (42)</li>\n<li>Genes are immortal because of its replication property</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Replicators' three properties:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>longevity</li>\n<li>fecundity</li>\n<li>copying-fidelity</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gene Machine</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Negative feedback in survival machine: The machine will automatically \"tend to reduce the discrepancy ... and it may actually come to rest if the 'desired' state is reached\" (65)\n<ul>\n<li>Like cost function in machine learning!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\"The goal of a machine is simply defined as that state to which it tends to return. Modern purpose machines use extensions of basic principles like negative feedback to achieve much more complex 'lifelike' behavior.\" (66)\n<ul>\n<li>like... gradient descent?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Gene encodings are super powerful but also super slow. Behavior is super fast.\n<ul>\n<li>Gene encodings cannot overfit or be too specific ... must be generic enough ... You cannot have a gene that says \"act in this certain way when the wind blows this specific way\" any more than you can have a ML model that memorizes the same image.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\"One way for genes to solve the problem of making predictions in rather unpredictable environments is to build in a capacity for learning\" (73)</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Perhaps consciousness arises when the brain's simulation of the world becomes so complete that it must include a model of itself\" (76)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\"... the simulation itself could be regarded as part of the world to be simulated...
