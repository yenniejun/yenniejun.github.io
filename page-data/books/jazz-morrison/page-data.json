I really liked that the first part of the book just opened up with a TL;DR of the story (literally, the first two paragraphs is that Joe shot his lover and Violet let the birds go and went crazy). There's no hiding about the plot. This book is not about the complexity of the plot; it is about the complexity of the psyche. And it's similar to how a jazz standard opens — it states the \"plot\" once, plainly, before going on to improvise. There are no secrets on the general skeleton of the plot. The rest of the book are the different improvisation sections. The views into the different characters' minds is like the solo sections of different instruments. And the ending (once Felice shows up to the Traces' doorstep) is basically the coda.</p>\n<h2>Some quotes I liked from the book:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\"Can't rival the dead for love. Lose every time.\" (15)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"... It is impossible to have nothing to do, no sequence of errands, list of tasks\" (15)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"The notion of rest, it's attractive to her, but i don't think she would like it. They are all like that, these women. Waiting for the ease, the space that need not be filled with anything other than the drift of their own thoughts. But they wouldn't like it. They are busy thinking of ways to be busier because such a space of nothing pressing to do would knock them down ... They fill their minds and hands with soap and repair ... Molten. Thick and slow-moving.\" (16)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"... which pleased the slow-moving whores, <strong>who never hurried anything but love</strong>\" (17)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"How soon country people forget. When they fall in love with a city, it is for forever, and it is like forever.\" (33)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"<strong>There is no air in the City but there is breath\"</strong> (34)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"He forgets a sun that used to slide up like the yolk of a good country egg, thick and red-orange at the bottom of the sky, and he doesn't miss it, doesn't look up to see what happened to it or to stars made irrelevant by the light of thrilling, wasteful street lamps\" (34)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"The weekends, destined to disappoint\" (50)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"The brothers turn up the wattage of their smiles\" (67)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"I don't understand women like you. <strong>Women with knives</strong>.\" (85)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"By and by longing became heavier than sex: a panting, unmanageable craving. She was limp in its thrall or rigid in an effort to dismiss it.\" (108)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"His mind soaked and sodden with sorrow, or dry and brittle with the hopelessness that comes with knowing too little and feeling too much (so brittle, so dry he is in danger of the reverse: feeling nothing and knowing everything)\" (161)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"Where did you pick up a wild woman? / In the woods. Where wild women grow.\" (171)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"But now they were full of her, a simple-minded woman too silly to beg for a living ... She was powerless, invisible, wastefully daft**.
