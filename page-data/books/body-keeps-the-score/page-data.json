In the \"nature vs. nurture\" argument, he (indirectly) seems to take a firm stance that nurture is possibly a lot more important than nature. van der Kolk argues that childhood abuse is perhaps one of America's biggest public health crises right now, and something that is not getting as much support and attention as it should.</p>\n<p>Through the book, he shares first-hand stories of the trauma patients he has worked with, the different treatments he has tried, and his learnings from all of these experiences. He starts with his initial work with Vietnam War veterans, and the difference between those who experience trauma as adults (i.e. war, car accidents, loss of family members) and those who experience trauma in childhood (this affects the development of your brain in very negative ways)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Overall: I learned a lot about trauma. This book has convinced me in the \"nature vs nurture\" debate that perhaps nurture has more of an influence than we think. It almost seemed like Kolk's (indirect) message was that nurture is possibly a lot more important than nature. Kolk's argument is that childhood abuse is perhaps one of America's biggest public crises right now, and something that is not getting as much support as it should. A lot of psychiatrists or doctors resort to prescribing pills but that is not always the best solution for things like this.</p>\n<h1>Notes</h1>\n<h2>There is a lot we do not know about trauma</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\"We had only one real textbook... our patients.
