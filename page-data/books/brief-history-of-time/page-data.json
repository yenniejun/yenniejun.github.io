The physical book that I read was published in 1988 and actually used by my dad when he was in college (so, it's really old). The thought that comes to mind is: How timeless is time. Or rather, how timeless is humanity's musing about time?</p>\n<p>I found profound the ending (conclusion) of the book, in which Stephen Hawking talks about how humans have always wondered about the creation of the universe, and how even if we were able to figure out the unified theory of physics, it would only explain the \"how\" the universe was formed; the \"why\" we as humans would work together to keep pondering. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Even if there is only one possible unified theory, it is just a set of rules and equations. What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe? The usual approach of science of constructing a mathematical model cannot answer the questions of why there should be a universe for the model to describe. Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing? Is the unified theory so compelling that it brings about its own existence? Or does it need a creator, and, if so, does he have any other effect on the universe? And who created him\" (174)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the conclusion, Hawking also describes how scientists until now have been too occupied with figuring out WHAT the universe is and not WHY. Philosophers have traditionally asked the WHY questions but now the scientific theories have gotten too technical.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"If we do discover a complete theory, it should in time be understandable in broad principle by everyone, not just a few scientists. Then we shall all, philosophers, scientists, and just ordinary people, be able to take part in the discussion of the question of why it is that we and the universe exist. If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason - for then we would know the mind of God.\" (175)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Maybe half of the book went over my head, but I still enjoyed it. It blew my mind more than half of the time. Even having two physics parents didn't help; some of these concepts are just really confusing. However, seeing as how my purpose wasn't to understand all physics concepts in their entirety, but to get the big picture, I really enjoyed this book. Stephen Hawking was able to explain many of the major physics and astronomy related breakthroughs in the past couple hundred years in concise and narrative terms that made reading this book enjoyable.</p>\n<h1>Notes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Aristotle vs. Newton and Galileo</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aristotle - preferred state of rest (17) which any body would take up if it were not driven by some force or impulse</li>\n<li>Newton - there is no absolute space; there is no unique standard of rest</li>\n<li>Einstein - there is no absolute time (theory of relativity); each observer must have his own measure of time</li>\n<li>Space and time are now both dynamic quantities (33)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Friedmann Model</p>\n<ul>\n<li>at some point in the past the distance between neighboring galaxies must have been zero</li>\n<li>big bang - \"density of the universe and the curvature of space-time would have been infinite\" (46)</li>\n<li>can't deal with infinite numbers in math, so general theory of relativity breaks down at the <strong>singularity</strong></li>\n<li>curvature of space time is infinite in the big bang singularity</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>General relativity is an incomplete theory</li>\n<li>\n<p>Uncertainty Principle</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Marquis de Laplace (nineteenth century) argued that the universe is completely <strong>deterministic</strong> (scientific determinism)</li>\n<li>\n<p>Werner Heisenberg (1926) - Uncertainty Principle</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"In order to predict the future position and velocity of a particle, one has to be able to measure its present position and velocity accurately\" (54) ... the more accurately you try to measure the position of the particle, the less accurately you can measure its speed, and vice versa</li>\n<li>Uncertainty principle puts an end to Laplace's dream of deterministic universe model</li>\n<li>\"One certainly cannot predict future events exactly if one cannot even measure the present state of the universe precisely!\" (55)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Schrodinger, Heisenberg, Paul Dirac → Quantum mechanics (based on uncertainty principle)</li>\n<li>Einstein - never accepted universe was governed by change (\"God does not play dice\")</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Elementary Particles</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WHAT ARE THEY?</li>\n<li>Aristotle - matter is continuous</li>\n<li>Democritus - matter is grainy</li>\n<li>Atom is smaller than wavelength of light, so we cannot \"look\"  at the parts of an atom ...
