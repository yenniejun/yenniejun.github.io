Temporal word embeddings are used to determine the words that consistently describe vaccine discourse for each country over a period of eight weeks in 2021. To address the instability of word embedding models, over 800 models are trained by bootstrapping training documents. Using the ensemble of bootstrapped models, the role of local and global real-world events in shaping vaccine discourse is evaluated. Finally, these results are operationalized by translating the above insights into a decision-making tool to empower public health officials for better understanding, combating, and monitoring the infodemic."],"codelink":"https://github.com/yenniejun/thesis-radio","tags":["NLP"]},{"title":"Memes in the Wild: Assessing the Generalizability of the Hateful Memes Challenge Dataset","image":"projects-memes.png","description":["In this paper, we evaluate Facebook’s Hateful Memes Challenge using unimodal and mulitmodal models and assesses the deployment gap between synthetic memes and memes in the wild.
